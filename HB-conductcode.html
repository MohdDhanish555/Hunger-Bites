<h1>Foodie Code of Conduct</h1>
<h2>Keep out the clutter</h2>
<p>To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality content that's useful to everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long for dine-in reviews.. That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover the food, service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters. We do not have 140 characters limit for an online order review. However, if any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the review altogether.</p> 

<h2>Keep it relevant</h2>
<p> Please keep your contributions relevant to Hunger Bites. Accounts placing irrelevant, inappropriate, or promotional content, reviews with similar digital signatures that spam restaurants, or are based on any already disclaimed or informed policies and practices of a restaurant may be deleted without notice. If your review has been removed or moderated by us and if you repost another experience for the same restaurant, we reserve the right to remove that review too, even though such review might be in line with our content guidelines. In the case of spam, we can restrict your review activity on Hunger Bites.</p>

<h2>Keep it clean</h2>
<p>Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed account of your meal, keep foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like you, hate junk and will delete it whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to) derogatory comments on someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or indication of a personal vendetta against a business and its associates.</p> 

<h2>Keep it fresh</h2>
<p> Only one review per restaurant for a dine out experience and one review for each online order transaction can be submitted and your most recent experience at a place counts. That's what is going to help people when they're trying to decide whether or not to eat there. You're free to edit and update your review based on subsequent visits at any time. Reviews about old experiences (more than 6 months old) will also be deleted from our platform.</p>

<h2>Keep it real</h2>
<p>Write your review based on facts and your own experiences (e.g. not a friend's or any hearsay experience or based on media reports). Please don't exaggerate or falsify your experience. We do not take sides in cases of dispute, so make sure you can stand by your word. Content that indicates the reviewer hasn't even visited or availed any services from the restaurant will be removed. For example, "Never been here, never want to. Management is horrible and the food is worse!" Deceptive, fake, or misleading reviews will be removed. Reviewing a bunch of fast-food outlets in quick succession (even if you eat at them more often than you should) is considered suspicious activity, and it's likely these reviews will be moderated. Accepting or soliciting a kickback – monetary or otherwise – in exchange for reviews or photographs is also not acceptable, and could result in removal of your profile.</p> 

<h2>Don't solicit</h2>
<p> Identifying or promoting yourself as an official Hunger Bites blogger, or using your status to solicit any kind of benefits (including but not limited to accepting money, free meals, drinks) in exchange for promotion, or at the threat of negative reviews on Hunger Bites, will not be tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are brought to our attention, we reserve the right to delete your Hunger Bites profile or take any other action that we may deem fit, no questions asked. Acts that constitute as 'Solicitation' include: <br>

Explicit/Implied agreement (written or verbal) to write reviews in exchange for money, a free meal(s), drinks, etc.
Being a part of social media groups (e.g. WhatsApp/Facebook or any other social media platform) which offer incentives in exchange of reviews.</p>
<h3>Don't steal</h3>
<p> Plagiarism is something we take seriously. Copying others' reviews or photos from Hunger Bites or other platforms,, or even re-posting your own in multiple places on Hunger Bites (in full or in part), is something that will not be tolerated and may be removed/ moderated.. We trust that you'll play fair and create your own content.</p>

<h3>Tell the whole story</h3>
<p> If you luck into a free meal or dine as a guest of the restaurant, or have a relevant association with a restaurant or its owners, give full disclosure in your review. We're sure that honesty is the best policy, and other users will respect you even more for it. If you have made it to the major league as a food writer or critic, let us know and we can provide special access for your blog link to appear with your reviews. We love summaries, but incomplete reviews with a manually added link will be removed.</p>

<h3>Be yourself</h3>
<p> Your profile is your identity on Hunger Bites, so keep it real. You're welcome to use a screen name (foodonym, maybe?), but please refrain from using inappropriate names, bios, or profile images. We want to stay clean, and we might end up removing your account depending on how inappropriate your profile is.</p>

<h3>Don't misrepresent</h3>
<p> Identifying or promoting yourself as an official Hunger Bites blogger, or using your status to solicit benefits in exchange for promotion or at the threat of negative reviews on Hunger Bites will not be tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are brought to our attention, we reserve the right to delete your Hunger Bites profile, no questions asked.</p>

<h3>Don’t be a bully</h3>
<p> We take allegations of blackmail or threatening behavior against restaurants and its associates very seriously. This activity is strictly against our guidelines and may also be illegal in many locations. Reviews submitted in an attempt to blackmail a restaurant and its associates will be deleted.</p>

<h3>Play by the rules</h3>
<p> The content you add should be in compliance with Hunger Bites's Terms and Conditions, including terms and conditions of any of Hunger Bites products such as Hunger Bites Gold, Online Ordering, or Hunger Bites Treats, as well as the prevailing local laws and regulations. Local laws take precedence, and content may be moderated or deleted to adhere to these.</p>
