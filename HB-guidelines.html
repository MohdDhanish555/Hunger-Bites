   <h1> Guidelines and Policies</h1>

<p> If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the great foodie moments you have. Bouquets when the food exceeds your expectations, brickbats when the service is shocking, chronicles of your food excursions â€“ they all count.

While we welcome your opinions and descriptions of your dining experiences, there are a few things we expect from every user on <b>Hunger Bites</b>. Your reviews and photos, as well as your profile and the comments you share, are all subject to <b>Content Guidelines</b>, our Foodie Code of Conduct.</p>

This could include altering or deleting your reviews or comments, restricting your review activity or deleting your Hunger Bites account altogether, with or without notice. <b>Hunger Bites</b> also utilizes an algorithm to aid in removing suspicious reviews. If you feel your review was deleted in error, email us at <b>help@HungerBites.com.</b>
